# :robot: Programs, Variables and Strings

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

It is time to start building some scripts in Python.  These are essentially executable programs.  Part of this assignment will be completed in Colabs and part will be done on your Raspberry Pi.

The goal of this lab assignment is to introduce you to scripts (programs), Variables and Strings (or lists) in Python. 🚀

#### One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate **variables**. A variable is a name that refers to a value.  Understanding variables allows us to use and manipulate strings and other variable types using Python operators.  These tasks may be bundled into scripts that run whenever executed on any device or application that has the Python environment installed.

## 💻 Terms to know
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- scripts
- variable assignments
- reserved words
- strings or lists
- math operators
- parsing

## 📝 Next steps
1. Complete the work in the notebook here (5.4.1-Python_Programs_Variables_Strings.ipynb).
2. After you are done, add a text box at the bottom which describes what you learned about Python in this lesson.
3. On your raspberry pi, write a script that does the following:
    - Creates a variable which contains any full sentence (Name that variable sentence).
    - Use the `len` operator to determine the number of characters in that sentence - store that value in another variable called length.
    - Use the one print command and the necessary operators to print a statement which includes what the first word, last word and length of the sentence. 
    - For example: `the first and last words of this sentence are "It" and "times" and the sentence is 52 letters long, including spaces.`
3. Copy that script into a code box and put it at the bottom of your notebook.
5. Download the notebook as an ".ipynb" file on your computer.
6. Rename the file as "Python_5.4.1_submission.ipynb" and upload it to this repository.
